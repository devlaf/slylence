#### What Is this?

A WebExtension that allows you to hide all Slack messages coming from specified users.  Think IRC /ignore, but for Slack.


#### Where can I use this?

Tested on Firefox (51.0.1), Chrome (57.0.2987), and Opera(43.0).  Obviously this is only designed to work with the Slack web interface.
